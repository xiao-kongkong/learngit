<H1>5-Axis Waterjet Machining Services</H1>
<P>Ormond specializes in difficult or advanced waterjet machining processes, 
making it possible to generate complex components from difficult 
materials.&nbsp; The technologies available at Ormond often make it possible to 
reduce manufacturing costs and open up design options in applications that 
otherwise rely on methods such as electric discharge machining (EDM), and 
chem-milling. </P>
<P>Many unique waterjet-machining technologies that can not be performed with 
commercially available tooling or methods are made available at Ormond through 
in-house contract machining services.&nbsp; Ormond has large precision 5-axis 
machines available to implement special technologies. </P>

<H1>Drilling</H1>
<P>The abrasive waterjet can be used to drill holes in difficult materials such 
as Inconel or ceramics.&nbsp; Ormond's engineers have developed specialized 
hardware and processes to drill holes as small as 0.0075 inches in 
diameter.&nbsp; The abrasive waterjet can be used to drill holes at shallow 
angles through coated materials such as thermal barrier coated jet engine 
parts.&nbsp; A common advantage of the abrasive waterjet drilling process is the 
improved fatigue performance and improved hole repeatability.&nbsp; In addition 
to drilling shaped holes, the abrasive waterjet drilling process is capable of 
drilling deep holes through difficult to machine materials.&nbsp; An example of 
a high aspect drilling application at Ormond is 0.084+/-0.004 inch diameter in 
3-inch thick heat treated 15-5 stainless steel. </P>

<P>The patented Ormond abrasive waterjet machining technology is used to mill 
controlled depth channels and pockets in challenging aerospace and high 
temperature materials.&nbsp; A proprietary software package makes it possible to 
mill complex shapes into contoured surfaces in materials such as nickel alloys, 
ceramics and tool steels.&nbsp; This has been an enabling technology in several 
difficult Air Force applications, making it possible for engine developers to 
push the envelope with their designs. </P>

</P><A name=cavitation_peening></A>
<H1>Cavitation Peening</H1>
<P>Cavitation peening is a new technology that can generate high magnitude deep 
compressive stresses in metals and ceramics without roughening the surface of 
the part.&nbsp; It is used to improve fatigue resistance and increase the size 
of material flaw that can be tolerated in fatigue prone components.&nbsp; It was 
shown to significantly increase impact fracture damage resistance in brittle 
components.&nbsp; Hydraulic tubing peened by Ormond for the V-22 demonstrated 
increased fatigue life from less than 25,000 cycles to greater than 500,000 
cycles. </P>
<P>This low cost process is capable of creating residual stresses deeper than 
0.040 inch and can be used to process very small stress-concentration features, 
such as between gear teeth and in thread roots.&nbsp; Cavitation peening does 
not require the use of shot of any kind, but uses only a jet of high velocity 
fluid to generate shock waves and create residual stresses.&nbsp; The peening 
intensity is easily controlled, by varying the process parameters. </P>

<H1>Machining Ceramics</H1>
<P>Conventional waterjets are not capable of providing satisfactory performance 
when machining some ceramics.&nbsp; Commercially available nozzles are limited 
by their wear resistance to abrasives that are aggressive enough to properly 
machine materials like alumina, boron carbide or silicon. However Ormond has 
developed a new ceramic composite nozzle that is 100 times more wear resistant 
than commercial nozzles when using abrasives that cut ceramics several times 
faster than commonly used garnet.&nbsp; This nozzle wear resistance is key 
because wear would otherwise degrade the machining process control in only 
minutes.&nbsp; Ormond waterjet milling rates in silicon carbide are more than 10 
times greater than diamond grinding and without generating damaging subsurface 
fractures.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Commercial waterjet machine tool manufacturers sell high quality equipment 
for supporting common waterjet machining applications, but advanced waterjet 
cutting often requires specialized tools designed to a particular 
application.&nbsp; The engineers at Ormond are experts at designing custom 
waterjet tooling to meet difficult applications.&nbsp; Ormond designs and 
fabricates custom waterjet tooling and accessories to support the customer’s 
special needs. </P>
<P><B>Custom machines:</B> Customers come to Ormond because commercially 
available waterjet machines don’t always meet their specific requirements.&nbsp; 
The Ormond staff identifies the complex needs of individual customers and single 
or multi-axis, large or small close tolerance machines of can be built to their 
special needs. </P>
<P>Professional CNC controllers are provided with these systems so customers can 
operate using the commercial CAD-CAM software to generate CNC programs in the 
same manner that milling machine code is generated.&nbsp; Ormond supplies custom 
post processors to generate waterjet CNC code using programs such as MasterCAM™. 
</P>
<P><B>Production Tooling: </B>The major players in the waterjet machine tool 
market supply a standard listing of waterjet components and machine tools in 
order to address the needs of a broad mix of customers.&nbsp; Ormond can provide 
support to customers who require custom tooling. </P>
<P>Engineers at Ormond understand the needs of businesses that perform high 
volume production and custom made tooling is designed and fabricated in order to 
support the high efficiency operations necessary in high volume production. </P>

<H1>About Waterjets</H1>
<H3>Waterjets</H3>
<P>The ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) pump technology used to create high-velocity 
waterjets was developed in the 1970s.&nbsp; Water is pumped at pressures up to 
90,000 psi and expelled through a sapphire orifice to form a fine, coherent 
cutting jet.&nbsp; At this pressure, the water is traveling at about 4,000 
feet/second when it emerges from the orifice. Waterjets typically have diameters 
from 0.003 to 0.020 inch, requiring 2 to 90 Hp at 55,000 psi. </P>
<P>Waterjets are generally used without the addition of abrasives to cut only 
soft materials such as food, paper products, cloth, leather, wood, fiberglass, 
and some aerospace composites.&nbsp; It is a valued technology in many 
applications due to the fact that it is easily automated and because of its 
ability to cut very thin kerf widths with little material loss. </P>
<H3>Abrasive Waterjets</H3>
<P>The capability of the UHP waterjet was extended in the early 1980s by adding 
abrasives to form the abrasive-waterjet (AWJ).&nbsp; The abrasive particles are 
entrained in the waterjet and transported at supersonic velocities to cut nearly 
any material.&nbsp; The AWJ has been shown to produce surfaces that are free 
from adverse mechanical, thermal, or metallurgical effects, and have found 
acceptance in cutting applications such as aerospace sheet metals and 
composites. </P>
<P>The waterjet developed in the AWJ flows through a mixing tube where abrasive 
particles are entrained in the jet.&nbsp; The high-velocity water flow in the 
mixing tube creates a vacuum that serves to draw air, which is used to transport 
abrasives from a hopper into the nozzle via a supply hose.&nbsp; A second 
function of the mixing tube is to force a transfer of energy from the waterjet 
to the particles, while holding the accelerated abrasive particles in a narrow 
collimated stream.&nbsp; Garnet abrasives are commonly used as the AWJ cutting 
medium. </P>
<P>The AWJ has advantages over other machining methods in many areas: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The AWJ easily machines titanium, nickel alloys and very hard brittle 
  materials 
  <LI>It is a cold cutting process, machining without creating thermal 
  distortions or thermally driven changes to the metallurgical and crystal 
  structure (no brittle recast or micro-cracks as left by laser and EDM) 
  <LI>The workpiece sees very low tool loads with the abrasive-waterjet and 
  machining delicate part features is an option 
  <LI>Glass and ceramic materials can be machined to complex shapes without the 
  sub-surface flaws created during grinding 
  <LI>Drilling small, deep holes is easily performed with the AWJ 
  <LI>AWJ cuts more materials and is faster than EDM 
  <LI>AWJ cuts more materials and is faster than laser with thick materials 
</LI></UL><BR>
<P>The AWJ has many advantages over other machining technologies, but has 
remained a niche market in part because of limitations involved in machining to 
close tolerances.&nbsp; The capabilities at Ormond make it feasible to address 
closer tolerance work and take advantage of AWJ benefits over a broader range of 
applications. </P><A name=ormond_contacts></A>
