<P><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting can be traced back to hydraulic mining of 
coal in the Soviet Union and New Zealand. Water was collected from streams and 
aimed to wash over a blasted rock face carrying away the loose coal and rock. Th 
is method of mining was redeveloped in South African gold mines to remove 
blasted rock from the work area into a collection drift or tunnel. In the 
California Gold Country between 1853-1886, pressurized water was first used to 
excavate soft gold rock from the mining surfaces. The pressurized water allowed 
the miner to stand further back from the face being washed. This was safer 
because there was less danger of being covered by a collapsing wall of blasted 
rock. By early 1900s this method of mining had re ached Prussia and Russia. In 
these two countries the pressurized water was used to wash blasted coal 
away.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the 1930s it was Russia that made the first attempt at 
actually cutting the rock with the pressurized water. A water cannon was used to 
generate a pressure of 7000 Bars.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the 1970s technology was developed in the USA that was 
capable of creating a 40,000 Bar pressure. Most of the waterjet mining growth 
after this involved combining a drill with the waterjet. In 1972 Professor 
Norman Franz of Michigan worked with McCartney Manufacturing Company to install 
the first industrial waterjet cutter. The equipment was installed in Alton 
Boxboard. Flow industries also began to market industrial waterjet cutting 
equipment. It was Flow Industries who added sand to a pressurized cleaning 
system to give metal a white finish. After this it was demonstrated that 
abrasive waterjet systems could cut through metal and ceramics. From here the 
waterjet cutting industry took off.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Most waterjet cutting theories explain waterjet cutting as a 
form of micro erosion as described here. Waterjet cutting works by forcing a 
large volume of water through a small orifice in the nozzle. The constant volume 
of water traveling through a reduced cross sectional area causes the particles 
to rapidly accelerate. This accelerated stream leaving the nozzle impacts the 
material to be cut. The extreme pressure of the accelerated water particles 
contacts a small area of the work piece. In this small area the work piece 
develops small cracks due to stream impact. The waterjet washes away the 
material that "erodes" from the surface of the work piece. The crack caused by 
the waterjet impact is now exposed to the waterjet. The extreme pressure and 
impact of particles in the following stream cause the small crack to propagate 
until the material is cut through.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting uses only a pressurized stream of water to 
cut through material. This type of cutting is limited to material with naturally 
occurring small cracks or softer material.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>Abrasive Waterjets:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Slurry: An abrasive waterjet slurry system mixes the 
abrasive with the water jet early in the system. This is done before the water 
is pressurized. Slurry systems then accelerate the abrasive particles with the 
water throughout the system. This causes more wear on the internal parts than an 
entrainment system.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Entrainment: An abrasive waterjet entrainment system mixes 
the abrasive with the waterjet in a mixing chamber just after the nozzle. In 
most systems being built today, a venturi effect is utilized to pull the 
abrasive into the waterjet. The abrasive pa rticles are accelerated into the 
stream and then with the stream out the orifice.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>Abrasive Water Suspension Jets:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>An abrasive water suspension jet system accelerates a 
suspension of abrasive in water through the system. This type of system appears 
to be more efficient than previously developed abrasive waterjet systems. *NOTE: 
Southwest Research Institute has patented a water/gel (SUPER-WATER (R)) abrasive 
system that cuts 0.006" wide. The intended use of this system is for micro 
machining.&nbsp; SUPER-WATER (R) was developed by Berkeley Chemical Research, 
Inc., and has been found better then water in many applications from cutting to 
cleaning.&nbsp; For more information on SUPER-WATER (R) please visit <A

size=+2>Applications</FONT></FONT></U></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Due to the uniqueness of waterjet cutting, there are many 
applications where it is more useful and economical than standard machining 
processes. In this section, some of the major applications and uses for waterjet 
cutting will be discussed, and the reasons why this method works better.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>First of all, waterjet cutting is used mostly to cut lower 
strength materials such as wood, plastics, and aluminum. When abrasives are 
added, stronger materials such as steel, and even some tool steels can be cut, 
although the applications are somewhat limited. Listed below are different 
applications, and reasons why waterjet cutting is used for each one.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><I>Printed Circuit Boards</I>: </FONT>For 
circuit boards, waterjet cutting is mostly used to cut out smaller boards from a 
large piece of stock. This is a desired method, since it has a very small kerf, 
or cutting width, and does not waste a lot of material. Because the stream is so 
concentrated, it can also cut very close to the given tolerances for parts 
mounted on the circuit board without damaging them. Another benefit is that 
waterjet cutting does not produce the vibrations and forces on the board that a 
saw would, and thus components would be less likely to be damaged.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><I><FONT size=+1>Wire Stripping</FONT></I>: Wire stripping 
is another application that can be used effectively in waterjet cutting. If no 
abrasives are used, the stream is powerful enough to remove any insulation from 
wires, without damaging the wires themselves. It is also much faster and 
efficient than using human power to strip wires.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><I>Food Preparation</I>: </FONT>The cutting of 
certain foods such as bread can also be easily done with waterjet cutting. Since 
the waterjet exerts such a small force on the food, it does not crush it, and 
with a small kerf width, very little is wasted.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1><I>Tool Steel</I>:</FONT> For abrasive 
waterjet cutting, tool steels are one application, although a limited one. It 
can be very useful though because tool steel is generally very difficult to cut 
with conventional machining methods, and may cause an unwanted byproduct: heat. 
Abrasive waterjets, however, do not produce heat that could alter the structure 
of the material being cut, and thus the strength of the tool is retained.</FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Arial><I><FONT size=+1>Wood Cutting</FONT></I><B>:</B> Woodworking 
is another application that abrasive waterjet machining can be used for. Since 
wood is a softer material compared to steel, almost all wood can be cut, and the 
abrasive particles sand the surface, leaving a smooth finish that doesn’t 
require sanding.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Since its development, waterjet machining has seen many 
improvements in its design. Many different types of abrasives, nozzles, flow 
rates, and jet positions have been experimented with to name a few. Here at 
Michigan Tech, one of the elements being researched is the type of abrasive 
used. Typically, garnet, which has a hardness of 8 on Mohs scale of hardness, is 
used because it is much harder than most materials and because it breaks in 
clean, sharp edges. Garnet is considered inexpensive when compared to abrasives 
like diamond, however, it still costs around $600 per ton of abrasive. Working 
with the Daimler-Chrysler Corporation, Michigan Tech has found a way to used 
crushed windshield glass as an acceptable replacement for garnet. Glass, which 
is made of silica and has a hardness of 6 of Mohs scale of hardness, is not as 
hard as garnet, however the cost of 1 ton of glass is about $50. As far as 
hardness is concerned, silica glass is still harder than most materials, and 
since it is crushed, the particles all have sharp edges that haven’t been worn 
due to erosion that might occur in garnet, which has to be mined. The other 
benefit for using silica is that all the glass being used is scrap window glass 
that would have otherwise been sent to a landfill where it would be of no 
use.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Several other improvements and experiments that are being 
worked on by other companies are:</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting is a very useful machining process that can 
be readily substituted for many other cutting methods; however, it has some 
limitations to what it can cut. Listed below are these limitations, and a brief 
description of each.</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>One of the main disadvantages of waterjet cutting is 
    that a limited number of materials can be cut economically. While it is 
    possible to cut tool steels, and other hard materials, the cutting rate has 
    to be greatly reduced, and the time to cut a part can be very long. Because 
    of this, waterjet cutting can be very costly and outweigh the 
    advantages.</FONT> </LI></UL>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Another disadvantage is that very thick parts can not 
    be cut with waterjet cutting and still hold dimensional accuracy. If the 
    part is too thick, the jet may dissipate some, and cause it to cut on a 
    diagonal, or to have a wider cut at the bottom of the part than the top. It 
    can also cause a ruff wave pattern on the cut surface.</FONT> </LI></UL>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Taper is also a problem with waterjet cutting in very 
    thick materials. Taper is when the jet exits the part at a different angle 
    than it enters the part, and can cause dimensional inaccuracy. Decreasing 
    the speed of the head may reduce this, although it can still be a 
    problem.</FONT> </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><A

<BR><A name=Advantage></A><BR><B><U><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+2>Advantages to 
Waterjet Cutting</FONT></FONT></U></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting has many applications, and there are many 
reasons why waterjet cutting is preferable over other cutting methods. Listed 
below are several advantages, along with a brief explanation.</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>In waterjet cutting, there is no heat generated. This 
    is especially useful for cutting tool steel and other metals where excessive 
    heat may change the properties of the material.</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Unlike machining or grinding, waterjet cutting does not 
    produce any dust or particles that are harmful if inhaled.</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>The kerf width in waterjet cutting is very small, and 
    very little material is wasted.</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting can be easily used to produce 
    prototype parts very efficiently. An operator can program the dimensions of 
    the part into the control station, and the waterjet will cut the part out 
    exactly as programmed. This is much faster and cheaper than drawing detailed 
    prints of a part and then having a machinist cut the part out.</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting can be easily automated for production 
    use.</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Waterjet cutting does not leave a burr or a rough edge, 
    and eliminates other machining operations such as finish sanding and 
    grinding.</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Arial>Waterjets are much lighter than equivalent laser 
    cutters, and when mounted on an automated robot. This reduces the problems 
    of accelerating and decelerating the robot head, as well as taking less 
    energy.</FONT> </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><A
